# To-Do List

First JS heavy project. I used some rough guidance from the internet and had help from a friend when I got stuck. 
We went through my code, and he explained how I could improve it and clean it up.

This is the finished code and I want to move on to a different problem, but I recognise there are still many areas to improve on.
E.g. breaking down the if statement further to make 2 functions for an easier reading experience
